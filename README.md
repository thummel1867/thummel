My name is Thomas! I'm an IT Support Technician and Full-Stack developer with an interest in environmentalism. 

Here's a short list of what can be found in my coding toolbox: 

- HTML5 
- JavaScript 
- CSS 
- Git 
- Github 
- Python 
- Node 
- Express.js 
- Django 
- Mongoose 
- SQL 

My coding philosophy is modivated by the desire to break down complex problems and to slowly synthesize them into something that a user can easily understand and enjoy.
